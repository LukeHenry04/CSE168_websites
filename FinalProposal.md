# CSE 168 Final Proposal
## Luke Henry

For my final project, I plan to implement a semi-lagrangian fluid simulator to render smoke using volumetric rendering. The project will involve adding a SmokeField class that contains a 3D vector field of flow velocities and scalar fields for pressure, temperature, and smoke density. I will be basing the physics on the Incompressible Navier Stokes equation, and applying external buoyancy, gravity, and vortex confinement forces to correct for the inconsistencies and inacuracies of semi-lagrangian advection. The project also involves rendering frames as the smoke fields change over small time steps. 

Semi-Lagrangian advection is a method for simulating fluid flow that uses a grid of flow velocities. It relies on the assumptions that relevant fields follow the flow velocity field (are advected through it) and that the velocity at a given point does not change much over the course of a time step. Using the latter assumption, to find the new velocity at a point `x` where `t = n+1`, the process involves looking up the velocity `u(x,t=n)` and tracing it back in space to find the point `x - u(x,t=n)`. This new point can be thought of as "where the fluid at point `x`, `t=n+1` came from. Based on the assumption that this is a good enough estimator, as the time steps approach 0 seconds, the simulation then takes all of the field values from that point and sets them as the new field values at point `x` at time `t=n+1`.
