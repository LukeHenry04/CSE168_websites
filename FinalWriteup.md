# CSE 168 Final - Fluid Simulation and Volumetric Rendering
## Luke Henry

For my final project, I implemented a semi-lagrangian fluid simulator to render smoke using volumetric rendering. The project uses a SmokeField class that contains a 3D vector field of flow velocities and scalar fields for pressure, temperature, and smoke density. The fields change based on the Incompressible Navier Stokes equation, with added external forces for buoyancy, gravity, and vortex confinement to correct for the inconsistencies and inacuracies of semi-lagrangian advection and the assumtion of constant density. The simulator allows enables the pathtracer to render multiple frames as the smoke fields change over small time steps, which have then been compiled into gifs. 

I found this paper from Stanford describing a particular method for rendering smoke that has sources that link to the basics of fluid simulation as well, which I have been referencing with respect to the math. I tried to use some of the same methods and equations used in the paper, including the Conjugate Gradient method for solving the pressure equation, monotonic cubic interpolation instead of trilinear interpolation, and the Henyey-Greenstein function for the phase probability in my volumetric rendering method.

Semi-Lagrangian advection is a method for simulating fluid flow that uses a grid of flow velocities. It relies on the assumptions that all relevant fields follow the flow velocity field (are advected through it) and that the velocity at a given point does not change much over the course of a time step. It is used to generate and update a discrete grid of points based on estimates where an analytical or continuous solution to the Navier Stokes equation is unstable or non-existent.

Both of the gifs above demonstrate the effects of advection, where the smoke moves along with the velocity field. The second gif shows viscosity, gravity and bouyancy forces applied as well. The main reason it does not look like smoke is because it lacks the pressure correction term from the Navier Stokes equation for incompressible fluids.

The Navier Stokes Equation for Incompressible Fluids with constant viscosity is:

Where `p` is pressure, `œÅ` is density which can be set to 1 as it is constant and unitless, and `v` is viscosity which can also be constant and very low, such as 0.001 for gasses like air and smoke.

The main assumption for incompressible fluids is that the divergence of the velocity vield at any point is 0, so that density is constant. The main term in the equation is the Gradient of the pressure field, and in order for this assumption to hold, the following Poisson Equation for pressure must be solved to find the correct pressure field values:

This process involves solving an extremely large linear matrix equation `Ap = b` where A is a sparce matrix that has many 0's. Again, an analytical solution would be far too complex and expensive to compute, so an iterative solver is used instead. In this case, I used the Conjugate Gradient method, which is supposed to converge faster than many other methods for large, symmetric matrices. The matrix `A` in this context is a matrix relating each cell to its 6 nearest neighbors. It contains a row for every pressure value in the field, but most of each row is 0. Multiplying it by a field ultimately means taking a rescaled, weighted sum of the value at each cell with the values at its directly neighboring cells. The conjugate gradient method involves calculating a search direction and step size based on a residual from `b`, where `b` is simply the divergence of the velocity field, then taking small steps in the search direction and refining each value over multiple iterations. 

With the solver applied (and simple linear interpolation), we get results like this:

When sampling a point within the grid, interpolation is used to blend between corners of each voxel. Linear interpolation, shown above, works but ends up blending away a lot of finer details. I implemented the monotonic cubic interpolation used in the Standford paper above. Unlike linear interpolation that requires 2 input points, cubic interpolation requires 4. In 3 dimensions this results in 64 grid points being used for interpolation at each sample. The performance slowdown is very noticable, but the quality of the smoke even without volumetric rendering is noticably sharper with cubic interpolation enabled:

After implementing the main fluid simulator, I also added a vortex confinement force, also as described in the Stanford paper above, which tries to add back some of the spiraling turbulent patterns that are lost between the interpolation, advection approximations, and finite resolution grid. This force is proportional to the gradient of the curl of the velocity field, and added in makes the simulation look like this:

Once the simulation was running well, the last feature I implemented was simple volumetric rendering. The raytracer uses an integrater called "smokeOnly" which marches along each ray and calculates monte carlo direct lighting for each point along the main ray. It does this my sending out rays to each light (stratified and sampled using the same techniques as in homework 2), but instead of using a brdf, it first integrates the smoke field along the ray to get an amount of smoke between the point and the light.
